    STANWELL PARK BEACH - THE CREATION OF A LEGEND
    Stanwell Park was possibly named after the village of Stanwell on the south side of London. Stanwell Park was also known by the Aboriginal name 'Little Bulli'. Bulli means 'two mountains' and refers to the mountains on either side of the village. 'Little' was because Bulli already existed.
    
    Stanwell Park beach  is a coastal village and northern suburb of Wollongong, New South Wales, Australia. It is the northernmost point of the Illawarra coastal strip and lies south of Sydney's Royal National Park. It is situated in a small valley between Bald Hill to the north, Stanwell Tops to the west and Mount Mitchell to the south. It has two lagoons from the village's two creeks, Stanwell and Hargrave Creeks and a beach running between headlands.
     
    History and cultures
    The area was originally inhabited by the Wodi Wodi Aboriginal clan of the Tharawal people. It was traversed by 3 shipwrecked sailors in an epic journey of survival along hundreds of miles of coastline until rescued at Wattamolla, north of Stanwell Park. Stanwell Park was the name given to the farm established on the grant given to Matthew John Gibbons in 1824. He was given most of the area called Little Bulli which included present-day Stanwell beach and coalcliff. The whole of Northern Illawarra went under the Aboriginal name Bulli. Bulli remains the name of an Illawarra suburb further south of Stanwell beach. 
    
    Features
    Stanwell Park Beach north of Wollongong, New South Wales, is one of the most visually attractive beaches in Australia. The Illawarra Escarpment rises dramatically behind it, with steep cliffs either side and the beach itself in something of a natural amphitheatre.
    
    Safety
    It's not the longest beach in New South Wales - it's around 850 km long. And neither is it the safest. Swimmers need to beware of a series of rips. Perhaps more than on many other Australian beaches, it's important to swim between the red and yellow flags.
    
    Geomorphic processes 
    Coastal storms have been considered significant agents in transporting sediment, modifying morphology and causing recent beach erosion. Along the New South Wales coast, the concomitance of storms, warmer sea surface temperatures and poleward movement of the Hadley cell was linked to beach erosion on Stanwell Park beach between 1943 and 1978. This result was defined using an accurately constructed compilation of coastal storms and a precisely measured time series of high tide positions taken from 105 oblique photographs. The two data sets are amongst the best of their kind in the world. Indices of storm magnitude, representing cumulative significant wave height, were constructed at quarterly intervals and for the year prior to each photograph. The quarterly and cumulative storm indices explain 9.9% and 16.6% respectively, of the high tide variance at Stanwell Park. Each unit increase in the latter index, equivalent to an additional 1 m in storm wave height, shifts the high tide position shoreward by 0.47 m. This is equivalent to the effect produced by a 1 cm rise in sea level.
    
    This is how Stanwell Park Beach came to be, but over time it will continue to change even more.
